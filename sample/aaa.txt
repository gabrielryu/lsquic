QUIC:
The transport protocol described by this document. QUIC is a name, not an acronym.
Endpoint:
An entity that can participate in a QUIC connection by generating, receiving, and processing QUIC packets. There are only two types of endpoint in QUIC: client and server.
Client:
The endpoint that initiates a QUIC connection.
Server:
The endpoint that accepts a QUIC connection.
QUIC packet:
A complete processable unit of QUIC that can be encapsulated in a UDP datagram. One or more QUIC packets can be encapsulated in a single UDP datagram.
Ack-eliciting Packet:
A QUIC packet that contains frames other than ACK, PADDING, and CONNECTION_CLOSE. These cause a recipient to send an acknowledgment; see Section 13.2.1.
Frame:
A unit of structured protocol information. There are multiple frame types, each of which carries different information. Frames are contained in QUIC packets.
Address:
When used without qualification, the tuple of IP version, IP address, and UDP port number that represents one end of a network path.
